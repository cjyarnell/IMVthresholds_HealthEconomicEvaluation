# IMVthresholds_HealthEconomicEvaluation
 
This repository contains all of the Treeage and R files used to conduct our health economic analysis comparing three different oxygenation thresholds for invasive ventilation to usual care in people with hypoxemic respiratory failure. 

Contents:
- model diagram (Powerpoint file, a more reasonable image format pending)
- primary decision tree for simulation in Treeage (MIMIC_CUA) to generate a probabilisitic sensitivity analysis
- R files to process the probabilistic sensitivity analysis (process_PSA.R, psa_functions.R)
- R file to calculate the expected value of sample information (EVSI.R, EVSI_functions.R)

Note that you need to use the Sheffield Value of Information web application for the expected value of perfect and partial perfect information (https://savi.shef.ac.uk/SAVI/).

Our preprint will be posted shortly and will contain all the relevant references.

Feel free to reach out with any questions, advice, requests!
