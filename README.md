# IMVthresholds_HealthEconomicEvaluation
 
This repository contains all of the Treeage and R files used to conduct our health economic analysis comparing a threshold for invasive ventilation to usual care in people with hypoxemic respiratory failure. We considered two scenarios ("primary" and "secondary"). 

Contents:
- model diagram for primary and secondary scenarios
- decision tree for simulation in Treeage for both which can be used to generate a probabilisitic sensitivity analysis
- R files to process the probabilistic sensitivity analysis (process_PSA_primary.R, process_PSA_secondary.R, psa_functions.R)
- R file to calculate the expected value of sample information (EVSI.R, EVSI_functions.R)

Note that you need to use the Sheffield Value of Information web application for the expected value of perfect and partial perfect information (https://savi.shef.ac.uk/SAVI/).

Our preprint has been posted at https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.16.23286754v1 and contains all the relevant references.
